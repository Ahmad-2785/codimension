Virtual canvas to represent a control flow
The basic idea is to split the canvas into cells and each cell could
be whether a vacant or filled with a certain graphics element.

At the very beginning the canvas is empty and can grow left, right or down
when a new element needs to be inserted.

The whole canvas is split into independent sections. The growing in one section
does not affect all the other sections.

class VirtualCanvas:
    " Holds the control flow representation "

    def __init__( self ):
        self.cells = [[]]       # Stores the item instances from items.py

    def render( self, settings ):
        " Preforms rendering for all the cells "
        return

    def draw( self, canvas ):
        " Draws the diagram on the real canvas "
        return

    def layout( self, controlFlow ):
        " Does the layout "
        return
